        <subject>Discovery</subject>
        <desc>Discovery is about establishing contact and building a relationship with a potential new member node. In this phase, it is determined if DataONE and the repository are a good fit for one another and if the repository generally meets the requirements of DataONE member nodes. Broad discussions of deployment options may be reviewed as well.
This story is complete when a determination is made to either proceed with planning a new deployment, or that joining DataONE is not an option for the repository at this time.

                <subject>Feasibility Assessment</subject>
                <desc>Initial determination of operational and technical feasibility. Addresses:

***Operational Feasibility:***

* Repository meets sustainability expectations.

***Technical Feasibility:***

* What data will be exposed?
* Content mutability.
* Software needs:
 * DataONE software stack or implement new web service in existing applications (custom stack)?
 * Full repository or Slender Node?
 * metadata only or science data + replication?
 * Repository's in-house preferences? (Java? Python?)
* Consistency of metadata quality.
* Level of functionality (tier).

* Communicate knowledge of technical requirements for selected deployment. These can include:
 * SSL certificate.
 * FQDN.
 * Apache web server with Python 2.7 or Java (depending on stack).
* Confirm metadata format. Communicate expectations for metadata quality.
* Specify in advance whether a separate test installation will be maintained in parallel with production. This is important for planning the deployment. A separate test will need distinct subdomain and SSL cert if not using wildcard.

* Change node's primary MNDeployment ticket status to Testing.

* Identity Management:
 * Confirm what nodeID will be used.
 * Register NCEAS LDAP (https://identity.nceas.ucsb.edu/) because cert download auth is maintained by separate system.
 * Use Use cilogon to generate a DataONE LDAP account by logging into DataONE test env. (Sign-in link at https://search-stage.test.dataone.org)


* DataONE Certificate:
 * Request in #CI for a sandbox or stage D1 certificate generated available to NCEAS uid.
 * Cert/key downloaded by node operator.

***For a custom implementation of DataONE APIs as new service:***

* MN implements full scope of Member Node APIs.
* API methods systematically verified by D1 tech lead.
* Passes web tester checks (http://mncheck.test.dataone.org:8080)

***For a DataONE Software Stack***

* Install software, SSL cert, and DataONE cert per installation instructions.
* If using LE cert, schedule cron for renewal.
* Configure software as appropriate (baseURL, Node Contact Subject, replication, etc).

***For a SlenderNode:***

* Develop adapter.
* Fully test movement of data from source system to target MN software.
* Install on MN web server and schedule cron job. Verify cron is running as expected.

***For both:***
* Verify system metadata of test records. Ensure correct node URI value in auth/orig MN.
* Verify node description document. Ensure that Contact Subject is set to the DataONE LDAP identity string.

                <desc>Custom nodes will start off by first registering in Sandbox. Nodes using an existing MN software will register in Stage.

* Node contact subject approved by D1 admin in DataONE LDAP.
* Node software configuration - synchronization enabled if applicable.
* Node registration document generated and submitted to Sandbox or Stage CN.
* D1 Admin approves node registration on the Sandbox or Stage CN server.
* Monitor and verify synchronization, indexing, search behavior.
* MN approves display of information in test search interface (https://search-sandbox.test.dataone.org/#data or https://search-stage.test.dataone.org/#data)

A note for custom implemented DataONE services: It's expected that development and testing will be more iterative. When satisfied with results in sandbox, repeat the process by changing target to cn-stage.

 * If applicable, adapter metadata reflects production URI too.
 * System metadata reflects production URI
 * Target CN is production hostname.
